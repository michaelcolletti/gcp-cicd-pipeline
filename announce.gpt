### Announcing the GCP CI/CD Pipeline Repository

*Experiment using gptscript to do an overview of a repo and is .autogenerated*
We are excited to introduce the **GCP CI/CD Pipeline** repository, a comprehensive solution for creating a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This repository is designed to streamline the deployment process for small test applications across development, testing, and production environments.

#### Key Features:
- **Declarative Build Pipeline**: Utilize `cloudbuild.yaml` to define and automate the build process, pushing container images to Artifact Registry and creating releases in Google Cloud Deploy.
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy your application using `clouddeploy.sh`, which sets up Kubernetes cluster definitions for dev, staging, and prod environments.
- **Skaffold Integration**: Leverage Skaffold for managing Kubernetes deployments with a declarative `skaffold.yaml`.
- **Manifest Creation**: Easily generate deployment manifests with `create-manifest.sh`.
- **Deployment Execution**: Execute deployments using `deploy.sh` and the `gcloud beta deploy` command.

#### Getting Started:
1. **Build Pipeline**: Run `cloudbuild.sh` to build and push your container image.
2. **Create Deployment**: Use `clouddeploy.sh` to set up your Kubernetes clusters.
3. **Run Deployment**: Deploy your application with `deploy.sh`.

#### Future Enhancements:
- Scripts for copying deployments and build files to a bucket.
- Validation scripts to ensure deployment integrity.

We invite you to explore the repository, contribute, and provide feedback. Together, we can enhance the CI/CD experience on GCP.
